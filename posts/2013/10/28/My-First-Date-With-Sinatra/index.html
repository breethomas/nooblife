            <p>My first date with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="blank">Sinatra</a> was a hot mess. And that damn tipped over
            rocks glass for error messages is enough to drive a girl to drink. </p>
            
            <p><img alt="" src="/images/rocks-glass.png" /></p>
            
            <p>Overly excited about building a web app, due to having some
            cursory experience with a little front-end dev, I decided to
            approach the Sinatra tutorial with guns a blazin’ and 
            follow the tutorial using <a href="http://haml.info/" target="blank">Haml</a> instead of ERB (short for "Embedded RuBy", not to be confused with "<a href="http://www.epicrapbattlesofhistory.com/" target="blank">Epic Rap Battles</a>"). I mean, how hard could
            it be? Talk about kicking my own ass… sheesh. </p>
            
            <p>First and foremost,
            <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html" target="blank">Ideabox</a> introduced the use of forms, which I had zero experience with
            and found them to be a tiny beast of weirdness all their own. Then,
            layer on top of that translating ERB instructions from the tutorial
            real-time into Haml had me and the spilled glass of Jack w/ water
            and three ice-cubes (the real <a href="http://jrcx.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/sinatrajd/" target="blank">Sinatra's poison </a> of choice) in lock step for the duration of the exercise.
            And I’m a vodka girl, so it wasn’t a pleasant experience,
            although spilling booze in any context is generally an unpleasant
            faux-pas. </p>
            
            <p>So where did I end up? Well… I completed the project, so
            there is that, but I certainly wasn’t proud of it and absolutely none
            of it was test driven. </p>
            
            <p>I did however, learn a lot. And the post exercise where we sat with <a href="https://github.com/jcasimir?source=cc" target="blank">Jeff</a>
            and worked through how to approach testing with Ideabox was hugely
            beneficial. That said, I would most definitely repeat the exercise,
            with TDD first and foremost, as well hopefully having some time to add
            more extensions and make the front-end pretty. Another piece of good
            news is that re-writing the views in Haml was an extension, which
            I only learned after the fact, which was a nice surprise. This
            was the first project since the start of school that I was able to
            complete in its entirety with an extension. <strong>Kazaam</strong>!!</p>
            
            <p>After the Sinatra shin-dig, we had our first “code retreat” at The
            Source in Denver. It was like speed-dating, but with code-pairing.
            And it was fantastic! All of my fellow students proved to be much
            better dates than Sinatra, if for no other reason than they didn’t keep
            spilling liquor on me. I especially enjoyed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)" target="blank">Groundhog Day</a> approach,
            where we kept repeating the same exercise over and over as we changed
            pairs. Even though the exercise was the same, the change in pairs
            and the application of learning from one session to the next really
            changed the dynamic of the exercise. Sometimes - I felt pretty stupid,
            but a lot of times, I actually contributed to the process of
            writing some code that worked. And that always feels great.</p>
