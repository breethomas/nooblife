            <p>I tried to insert ERB tags into haml.</p>
            
            <p>I got myself up "git creek" when I thought it would be cool to rebase. </p>
            
            <p>I lost hours googling my googles because I didn't understand the
            answers to my noob questions.</p>
            
            <p>I have yet to fully complete an in-class exercise during the allocated
            class time @ the <a href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/" target="blank">JumpstartLab</a>   </p>
            
            <p>I wrote eight lines of code for Event Reporter (first "real" project
            assigned with a one week turn time.) and none of them did
            anything.</p>
            
            <p>I spent an hour and a half relentlessly trying to debug a functional
            file that wasn't even the file I was requiring in the test suite I was
            working from - seriously. </p>
            
            <p>I never use the damn Pomodoro, even though I know I should, and my psyche suffers for it after I have spent a ridiculous number of hours straight looking at my monitor with no break. </p>
            
            <p>I have no idea what I am doing. And some of these things are just plain
            hysterical. I'll get there. Just keep swimmingâ€¦</p>
